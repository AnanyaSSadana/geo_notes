React is employed on the front-end, enabling the creation of a dynamic and interactive user interface. MongoDB is employed for data management. The application also employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for robust user authentication and secure password hashing.

🔒 With an emphasis on security and user-centric design, Geo-Notes offers a platform where users can pen down private musings or share communal tales, all anchored to geographical locations.
